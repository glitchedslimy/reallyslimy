**What are you doing Kobs?**

Huh, well let me tell you:
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on my own project which is a discord bot called [Koda](https://github.com/realkobu/KodaJS).
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning new stuff about AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure and Cloud Architecture as well as DevOps.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I like to talk with other people and share opinions and things in common!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new projects as well as open source projects this year.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to make my own music and drawing and designing some stuff sometimes, also I've experience on Operative System management (Linux and Windows).
